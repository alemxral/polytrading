The resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's approval rating poll aggregator, https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/. Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates the approval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market. If for any reason the resolution source is unavailable on the resolution date, resolution will be delayed up to 48 hours. If still unavailable following that delay, this market will resolve to 50/50. If Joe Biden is not President on the resolution date, this market will resolve according to the most recent available approval rating. The resolution date for this market will be on May 20, 2021 at 12:00 PM ET according to data published for the day of May 19, 2021.

Empirically speaking, having a live token will be considered fulfilled if official project channels announce the introduction of the token and it is live on mainnet, and swappable and acquirable (i.e. via Uniswap). In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or \u201clive\u201d, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet (in any form, including some sort of voucher), but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not \u201clive\u201d and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform. If OpenSea has a live token by December 31, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"Yes\". If the resolution date is reached and none of the projects have a token, the market will resolve to \"No\". In the case of ambiguity, the market will be resolved in good faith by the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

Empirically speaking, having a live token will be considered fulfilled if official project channels announce the introduction of the token and it is live on mainnet, and swappable and acquirable (i.e. via Uniswap). In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or \u201clive\u201d, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet (in any form, including some sort of voucher), but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not \u201clive\u201d and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform. If OpenSea has a live token by December 31, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"Yes\". If the resolution date is reached and none of the projects have a token, the market will resolve to \"No\". In the case of ambiguity, the market will be resolved in good faith by the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

    "description": "The 2022 French Open (also known as Roland-Garros) is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks, from May 22 to June 5, 2022, at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris, France, on outdoor clay courts.\n\nWorld No. 2 Daniil Medvedev is a favorite to win the title. His presence at the 2022 French Open, however, is uncertain due to a recent surgery, the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian conflict, and the fact that he signed up to play at the Libema Open, which starts the day after the French Open final. \n\nThis is a market on whether Daniil Medvedev will play at least one point in the French Open for the Men's Singles Tournament. \n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Daniil Medvedev plays at least one point in the 2022 French Open. For example, if Daniil Medvedev wins one point during a match in the 2022 French Open and the score is 15-0, or loses one point and the score is 0-15, then this will suffice to resolve the market to \"Yes.\" The market cannot resolve to \"Yes\" until Medvedev has actually played a point. \n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d if the first round of the 2022 French Open starts and Daniil Medvedev is not listed as a participant in any matches. If Medvedev is listed as a participant but does not play a single point, the market will also resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf the 2022 French Open has not started by June 15, 2022, 12:00, the market will resolve to 50-50.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from the French Open (presently found at https://www.rolandgarros.com/en-us/), however credible media sources will also suffice.",

However, this market will continue to use 64,688 ETH returned as the threshold for resolving the market to \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nOn 2/2/2022 Wormhole was exploited for approximately 93,750 ETH, as can be seen here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x629e7da20197a5429d30da36e77d06cdf796b71a#internaltx\n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the Wormhole hacker returns at least 69% of the exploited funds to Wormhole by February 9, 2022 11:59:59 PM ET, and \u201cNo\u201d otherwise.\u00a0\n\nAny official announcements by Wormhole (https://wormholenetwork.com/, https://twitter.com/wormholecrypto, etc) will be sufficient to resolve this market, as well as transactions from the hacker that return the funds to whichever relevant party or parties as determined by\u00a0Wormhole.\n\nFor the purposes of this market, 69% or more of the exploited funds means 64,688 ETH or more. or if other cryptocurrencies/currencies are sent instead, then at the time they were sent if their conversion into ETH was 64,688 ETH or more, it will suffice to resolve this market to \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nNote that if funds are returned to Wormhole in another way, and they confirm, it will count for this\u00a0market.\n",

If Coingecko is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with $ADA\u2019s price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

    "description": "This is a market on whether President Biden will mention coronavirus 3 or more times during his address to a joint session of Congress, scheduled to take place on April 28, 2021. This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if President Biden cumulatively mentions any of the following words three or more times: \u201ccoronavirus\u201d, \u201ccovid\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19\u201d. For example, this market would resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if Biden mentions \u201ccoronavirus\u201d 5 times and none of the other variants (5 cumulative mentions) or if he mentions \u201ccoronavirus\u201d twice and \u201ccovid\u201d twice (4 cumulative mentions). This market will resolve to \"No\" otherwise. The resolution source for this market will be the official transcript of the joint address, as published by an official White House source (https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/). Note that a mention of any of the listed words will be confirmed by searching the text of this document and counting the number of times that word appeared (all variations on capitalization will be counted). This market will resolve after an official transcript of the address is published and the number of mentions can be verified.\n\nUpdate: In response to trader inquiries, the market will resolve on April 29, 2021 at 9pm ET according to the transcript published at the resolution source that most accurately reflects the speech as presented by President Biden.",

The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polygon). \n\nThis market will resolve on the \u201cC\u201d (i.e. the closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cSun 21 November 2021, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. Note, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. To allow for updates, this market will resolve on the number listed for the referenced candle at exactly 12:25:00 PM ET, on November 21, 2021. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.) If CoinGecko is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with $MATIC\u2019s price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polygon). \n\nThis market will resolve on the \u201cC\u201d (i.e. the closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cSun 21 November 2021, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. Note, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. To allow for updates, this market will resolve on the number listed for the referenced candle at exactly 12:25:00 PM ET, on November 21, 2021. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.) If CoinGecko is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with $MATIC\u2019s price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if, for any date from April 23 to April 29 (inclusive), the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in India for that date was higher than 475,000. This market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d if there is not a single date from April 23 to April 29 (inclusive), where the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in India for that date was higher than 475,000. Specifically, at 8:00 PM ET each day from April 23 to April 30, 2021, the daily case total for all previous days will be checked. If that count is over 475,000 at the time of any one of those checks, this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d. If at the time of the final check, on April 30, 2021, 8:00 PM ET, the count for all previous dates never exceeds 475,000, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d. If the WHO website is down at the time of resolution, market resolution will be delayed until the website is restored, or if it is not restored within 48 hours, this market will resolve such that \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d shares are both worth 0.50 USDC.\n",

        "description": "This is a market on whether there will be any day from April 23 to April 29 with more than 475,000 daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in India. The resolution source for this market will be the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in India, as reported by the World Health Organization (https://covid19.who.int/region/searo/country/in). This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if, for any date from April 23 to April 29 (inclusive), the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in India for that date was higher than 475,000. This market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d if there is not a single date from April 23 to April 29 (inclusive), where the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in India for that date was higher than 475,000. Specifically, at 8:00 PM ET each day from April 23 to April 30, 2021, the daily case total for all previous days will be checked. If that count is over 475,000 at the time of any one of those checks, this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d. If at the time of the final check, on April 30, 2021, 8:00 PM ET, the count for all previous dates never exceeds 475,000, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d. If the WHO website is down at the time of resolution, market resolution will be delayed until the website is restored, or if it is not restored within 48 hours, this market will resolve such that \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d shares are both worth 0.50 USDC.\n",

This market will resolve solely on whether the first Starship launch intended to reach outer space will successfully reach 62 miles above sea level. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, this market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Japan for the date of August 27 was more than 1,000, and \u201cNo\u201d otherwise. The resolution source will be checked on August 28, 2021 12:00 PM ET. If data is not available, the resolution source will be checked 24 hours later, and so on until September 1, 2021 12:00 PM ET. If there is still no available data by then, the market will resolve to 50-50. If the WHO website is down at the time of the first check, market resolution will be delayed until the website is restored, or if it is not restored within 48 hours, this market will resolve to 50-50.

        "description": "Professional golfer Tiger Woods was injured badly in a car crash in Los Angeles, CA on February 23, 2021. Since then there has been much speculation on whether he will participate in major tournaments moving forward.\n\nThis market asks whether Tiger Woods will play in the 2022 US Masters Tournament - the 86th edition of the Masters Tournament and the first of the four major men's golf championships held in 2022. It is scheduled to be played from April 7\u201310, 2022 at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.\n\nIf Tiger Woods plays in the 2022 US Masters Tournament, this market will resolve to \"Yes\". Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe primary resolution sources will be official information from the Masters Tournament (e.g.https://www.masters.com/en_US/players/player_list.html, https://www.masters.com/en_US/players/player_8793.html?promo=bio_players) or the Augusta National Golf Club, however other credible reporting may be used.\n\nIf the 2022 Masters Tournament is cancelled altogether, this market will resolve 50-50.",

The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra-luna). \n\nThis market will resolve on the \u201cC\u201d (i.e. the closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cFri 19 November 2021, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. \nNote, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.)\nThe resolution data will be checked at 12:25:00 PM ET, on November 19 2021, and - if unavailable then - for every 3 hours until it is.\nIf CoinGecko is unavailable for the full day, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the price of Terra ($LUNA). Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra-luna). \n\nThis market will resolve on the \u201cC\u201d (i.e. the closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cFri 19 November 2021, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. \nNote, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.)\nThe resolution data will be checked at 12:25:00 PM ET, on November 19 2021, and - if unavailable then - for every 3 hours until it is.\nIf CoinGecko is unavailable for the full day, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the price of Terra ($LUNA). Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cardano). This market will resolve on the \u201cC\u201d (i.e. closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cFri 1 October 2021, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. Note, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. To allow for updates, this market will resolve on the number listed for the referenced candle at exactly 12:25:00 PM ET, on October 1, 2021. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.) If Coingecko is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with $ADA\u2019s price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cardano). This market will resolve on the \u201cC\u201d (i.e. closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cFri 1 October 2021, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. Note, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. To allow for updates, this market will resolve on the number listed for the referenced candle at exactly 12:25:00 PM ET, on October 1, 2021. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.) If Coingecko is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with $ADA\u2019s price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/avalanche). \n\nThis market will resolve on the \u201cC\u201d (i.e. the closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cFri 19 November 2021, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. \nNote, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.)\nThe resolution data will be checked at 12:25:00 PM ET, on November 19 2021, and - if unavailable then - for every 3 hours until it is.\nIf CoinGecko is unavailable for the full day, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the price of Avalanche (AVAX). Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",

The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/avalanche). \n\nThis market will resolve on the \u201cC\u201d (i.e. the closing price) listed for the candle titled \u201cFri 19 November 2021, 12:00:00\u201d, with the \u201cPrice\u201d tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. \nNote, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the \u201cC:\u201d when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.)\nThe resolution data will be checked at 12:25:00 PM ET, on November 19 2021, and - if unavailable then - for every 3 hours until it is.\nIf CoinGecko is unavailable for the full day, another credible source will be chosen in good faith to resolve the market. \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the price of Avalanche (AVAX). Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.",
